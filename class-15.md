# What makes a good team (there is no best team)

 

## There are hundreds and thousands of hours devoted to studying and understanding what makes a productive team. Researchers look at many different teams, for the gender mix of teams. To how teams socialize at work and outside of work. Researchers have also looked at the team leaders of teams and countless other factors about work teams. After years of studying failing and successful teams,  data shows that a good team has these qualities. From the research of psychologists and sociologist, the qualities of good productive teams are `Group Norms` and `equality`   

Good Teams

Giving everybody in the team equal rights and leadership makes a team jell together. When everyone has feels that they are heard and can speak there mind equally. The team members work together better and become more productive.

Taking advantage of individual strengths and an equal spread of duties help teams move through difficult times during team projects.

A team with a high "average social sensitivity"  also know as knowing others' feelings and adjusting to the situation helped keep people engaged with the team. 

Having a group norm that always everybody equal parts and allows each person to be an individual and giving people the freedom to express there individuality also helped teams be successful.
