# New ways to alter element positions using CSS

- Transform is a new to position `<html>` elements using `css{}`. Transform comes in two settings, two and three dimensional. 
the following is an example of transform

```css
div {
-webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
-moz-transform: scale(1.5);
-o-transform: scale(1.5);
transform: scale(1.5);}
```

Transform is not supported in all browsers. Chrome is the best browser to use for this property.

## CSS 3 and transitions

- Transitions allow developers to create `html` elements and change the elements behavior using `css`.the following is an example

```css.box {  
background: #2db34a;  
transition-property: 
background;transition-duration: 1s;  
transition-timing-function: linear;}
```

browser support is universal.
