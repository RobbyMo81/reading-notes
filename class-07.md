# functions
Most important part of JS is the Function. Functions is the do the work the code would like to make.

  - How are functions writen

  ```JS
  function whatIWantToNameMyFunc1 (paramaterHere2) {
    var3 boxesName4 = 'boxeContent' + 'paramaterHer'
  }

  whatIWantToNameMyFunc5(arguementHer6);

  ```
  In the example above please refer to the numbers at the end
  - 1) after the word function this part 'whatIWantToNameMyFunc1' will be the call. 
  - 2) inside the () is the 'paramaterHere2' this is how you can git information you want to change or use for your work. You can have multiple parameters in here.
  - 3) the var is what I call a box. this box has a name
  - 4) this will be the 'boxesName4' whatever happens after the '=' is the contentst of the 'boxesName4' by calling up the 'boxesName4' you can reuse the contents into somethin else insdie the function.
  - 5) this is called invoking your function. In our case if we want to invoke the function we have to use 'whatIWantToNameMyFunc1'. and we can invoke the function by giving it any 'paramaterHere1' we want.
  - 6) this is where you feed your function with information.
