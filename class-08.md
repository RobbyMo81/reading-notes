# CSS Layout

## Controlling the position of elements
Controlling the poisiton of elements and blocks can be difficult. The following are some examples could help.
- CSS treats html elements as there own little boxes. html elements can either be block-level or inline boxes.
  -block-level elements will start a new line examples include but are not limited to the following
  
  `<h1>`, ``<p>``, ``<ul>``, ``<li>``
  
  -inline elements flow in between surrounding text.
  
  `<img>` `<b>` `<i>`
  
- Containing elements. when and element is inside another element. they will have a relationship known as parent and child where the outer element is the parent and the inner element is the child. child elements can and mosty often do inheret their parent element. NOTE that some inhereted treats cannot be overriden.

`examples`
`<div>` inside a `<div>` 
`<body>` and everyother element.

### Controlling the position of the elements

- Positioning schemes
  -Normal flow this is also the defualt
  -Relative
  -Absolute
  -Fixed
  -Floating  another complimenting positioning schemes is the `z-index: values can be -1 and so on to 1 and so on;`
